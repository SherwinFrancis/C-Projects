In this repository you will find a collection of C projects by me they currently include:
-A derivative Calculator
-A program that will have a menu that gives options to print a rectangle on the user based dimensions or print all the odd numbers until the specified input number.
-A program which will generate a random integer within a specified range and then compute a sequence of numbers using a recursive formula following the recurrence relation: S(n) = S(n-1) + 2 * S(n-2) + 3 * S(n-3), with base cases S(1) = S(2) = S(3) = 1. The program utilizes stdlib.h for random number generation and time.h for seeding, showcasing the use of recursive functions and random number generation in C.
